# Company Onboarding Fix Guide

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Issue:** 500 Error when creating company during onboarding
**Status:** FIXED - Ready to deploy

---

## üî¥ Problem Summary

After successful signup and email verification, users reach the company onboarding page but encounter a **500 Internal Server Error** when trying to create their first company.

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Missing `created_by` field**: The company INSERT was missing the required `created_by` field (NOT NULL constraint)

2. **Incomplete company_members INSERT**: Missing required fields like `joined_at` and `status`

3. **RLS Policy Chicken-and-Egg Problem**:
   - The existing RLS policy required users to be owners/admins to add members
   - But during onboarding, the company_members table is empty
   - So users couldn't add themselves as the first owner!

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Updated Company Onboarding Page

**File:** `apps/platform/src/app/onboarding/company/page.js`

**Changes:**
1. Added `created_by: userId` to company INSERT
2. Added complete fields to company_members INSERT:
   - `invited_by: userId`
   - `joined_at: new Date().toISOString()`
   - `status: 'active'`

### Fix 2: New Migration 005

**File:** `packages/database/migrations/005_fix_company_members_rls.sql`

**Changes:**
1. **Dropped overly restrictive policy** that blocked all operations
2. **Added special INSERT policy** for company creators to add themselves as owner
3. **Added separate INSERT policy** for existing owners to add other members
4. **Added granular policies** for SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
5. **Added safeguard** preventing last owner from removing themselves

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Migration 005

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor**
2. Copy the contents of `packages/database/migrations/005_fix_company_members_rls.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click **Run**
5. Verify no errors appear

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes

The changes to `apps/platform/src/app/onboarding/company/page.js` need to be deployed:

```bash
# From project root
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve company onboarding 500 error

- Add created_by field to company INSERT
- Add complete fields to company_members INSERT
- See migration 005 for RLS policy fixes"
git push origin main
```

**Vercel will auto-deploy** within 1-2 minutes.

   - Check email inbox
   - Click confirmation link
   - Should redirect to `/callback` ‚Üí `/onboarding/company`

4. **Create company**:
   - Enter company name (required)
   - Enter industry (optional)
   - Click "Continue"

5. **Expected outcome**:
   - ‚úÖ No 500 error
   - ‚úÖ No console errors

## üîç Verification Queries

After running migration 005, verify the policies:

### Check Company Members Policies

```sql
SELECT
  policyname,
  cmd,
  roles,
  with_check IS NOT NULL AS has_check,
  qual IS NOT NULL AS has_using
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'company_members'
ORDER BY cmd, policyname;
```

**Expected output:**

| policyname | cmd | roles | has_check | has_using |
|------------|-----|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Company owners can add members | INSERT | {authenticated} | true | false |
| Users can add self as owner of own company | INSERT | {authenticated} | true | false |
| Company owners can delete members | DELETE | {authenticated} | false | true |
| Users can view company members | SELECT | {authenticated} | false | true |
| Company owners can update members | UPDATE | {authenticated} | false | true |

### Test Company Creation Manually

```sql
-- Check if a test user can create a company
-- Replace YOUR_USER_ID with actual user ID from auth.users

-- 1. Verify user exists
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

-- 2. Try to view what companies they can see (should be empty for new users)
SET request.jwt.claim.sub = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
SELECT * FROM companies;

-- 3. Check if they can add themselves as owner
SELECT * FROM company_members WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

---

## üêõ Debugging

### If 500 Error Still Occurs

1. **Check Supabase Postgres Logs**:
   - Dashboard ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Postgres Logs
   - Filter by "ERROR"
   - Look for INSERT failures or RLS violations

2. **Check if migration 005 ran successfully**:
   ```sql
   SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies
   WHERE tablename = 'company_members'
     AND policyname = 'Users can add self as owner of own company';
   ```
   - Should return 1 row
   - If empty, migration didn't run

3. **Check for schema conflicts**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify created_by column exists and is NOT NULL
   SELECT column_name, is_nullable, column_default
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'companies'
     AND column_name = 'created_by';
   ```

4. **Check Vercel deployment logs**:
   - Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest
   - Check for build errors
   - Ensure environment variables are set

### If Code Isn't Deploying

1. **Check git status**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Verify commit was pushed**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

3. **Check Vercel is connected**:
   - Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Git
   - Ensure GitHub repo is connected
   - Check deployment branch is `main`

## üìä Database State After Onboarding

After a successful onboarding, you should see:

### auth.users
```sql
SELECT id, email, email_confirmed_at FROM auth.users;
```
- User exists
- `email_confirmed_at` is NOT NULL

### public.users
```sql
SELECT id, email, onboarding_completed FROM public.users;
```
- User profile exists
- `onboarding_completed` = `true`

### public.companies
```sql
SELECT id, name, created_by FROM public.companies;
```
- Company exists
- `created_by` matches user ID

### public.company_members
```sql
SELECT company_id, user_id, role, status FROM public.company_members;
```
- Membership exists
- `role` = `'owner'`
- `status` = `'active'`

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ User signs up successfully
‚úÖ Email verification works
‚úÖ User redirected to company onboarding
‚úÖ Company creation succeeds (no 500 error)
‚úÖ User added as owner in company_members
‚úÖ onboarding_completed set to true
‚úÖ User redirected to dashboard
‚úÖ No errors in browser console
‚úÖ No errors in Supabase logs

---

## üîÑ What Happens Next

Once onboarding is complete, the user should:

1. **Land on `/dashboard`** - Basic dashboard page
2. **See navigation** - Access to create RFQs, view bids, etc.
3. **Be able to sign out** - And sign back in
4. **Not see onboarding again** - Middleware redirects to dashboard

---

## üìù Notes

- **Why the 403 error during signup?** That's expected - it's just your code trying to verify the profile was created, but RLS blocks it. The trigger handles profile creation, so that verification is unnecessary. We can remove it in a future cleanup.

- **Why did login work but onboarding didn't?** Because login just authenticates, but onboarding tries to INSERT data, which was blocked by RLS.

- **Why was the RLS policy wrong?** The original policy from migration 001 used `FOR ALL`, which is too restrictive. We needed separate INSERT policies for different scenarios.

- **Can users belong to multiple companies?** Yes! After onboarding, users can create more companies or be invited to join existing ones. The RLS policies support this.

---

## üö¶ Next Steps After This Works

Once onboarding is functional:

1. **Test the full auth flow**:
   - Signup ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Onboard ‚Üí Dashboard
   - Logout ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Dashboard
   - Password reset flow

2. **Build the dashboard**:
   - Currently just a placeholder
   - Needs company selector (if user has multiple)
   - Show recent RFQs, bids, etc.

3. **Start RFQ creation module**:
   - This is the core feature
   - Multi-step form with 1,558 questions
   - See HANDOFF_TO_NEXT_AGENT.md for details

**Good luck! This should resolve the 500 error.** üöÄ
