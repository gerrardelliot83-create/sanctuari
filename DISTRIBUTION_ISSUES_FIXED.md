# Distribution Issues Fixed - October 2, 2025

## Issues Reported

1. ✅ **Email not received** - UI says success but no email delivered
2. ✅ **Tracking page 404** - `/rfq/[id]/tracking` returns 404
3. ✅ **Wrong redirect from Bids screen** - Goes to `/distribute` instead of `/tracking`

---

## Issue 1: Email Not Received

### Problem
The UI shows "Invitations Sent Successfully!" but emails are not being delivered.

### Root Cause
Most likely one of these:
1. **BREVO_API_KEY not set** - Environment variable missing or invalid
2. **BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL not verified** - Brevo requires sender email verification
3. **API rate limits** - Brevo free tier has sending limits

### How to Debug

**Step 1: Check Server Console Logs**

After sending invitations, check your terminal/server logs for:

```
[Distribute API] Sending email to xxx@example.com with token abc123...
[Distribute API] Email result for xxx@example.com: { success: true/false, ... }
[Brevo] Email sent successfully: { to: ..., messageId: ... }
[Brevo] Email send failed: { error: ... }
```

**Step 2: Verify Environment Variables**

Check your `.env.local` file has:

```bash
BREVO_API_KEY=xkeysib-xxxxx  # Your Brevo API key from dashboard
BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@sanctuari.io  # Must be verified in Brevo
BREVO_SENDER_NAME=Sanctuari
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Or your production URL
```

**Step 3: Verify Brevo Setup**

1. Go to https://app.brevo.com
2. Navigate to **Settings → SMTP & API**
3. Copy your API key (starts with `xkeysib-`)
4. Go to **Senders** → Verify your sender email (`noreply@sanctuari.io`)
5. Check **Statistics** → **Email Activity** to see delivery status

**Step 4: Check Database Logs**

Query the `email_logs` table to see what happened:

```sql
SELECT * FROM email_logs
WHERE rfq_id = 'your-rfq-id'
ORDER BY sent_at DESC;
```

Check the `status` and `error_message` columns.

### Fix Applied

Added detailed console logging to help debug:

```javascript
console.log(`[Distribute API] Sending email to ${recipient.email} with token ${token}`);
console.log(`[Distribute API] Email result for ${recipient.email}:`, emailResult);
```

**Action Required:**
1. Set `BREVO_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. Verify sender email in Brevo dashboard
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Try sending invitations again
5. Check server console for detailed logs

## Issue 2: Tracking Page 404

### Problem
Clicking "View Distribution Status" after sending invitations returns 404.

### Root Cause
The tracking page (`/rfq/[id]/tracking`) didn't exist - it's a Week 2 feature.

### Fix Applied

**Created placeholder tracking page** with:

✅ **Files Created:**
- `/apps/platform/src/app/rfq/[id]/tracking/page.js`
- `/apps/platform/src/app/rfq/[id]/tracking/tracking.css`

✅ **Features Implemented:**
- Stats overview (Sent, Opened, Submitted, Total)
- Invitations list with status indicators
- Basic tracking of invitation records from database
- "Coming Soon" notice for Week 2 features

✅ **What Works Now:**
- Shows count of invitations sent
- Lists all invitations with email and status
- Shows sent date/time
- Clean, professional UI matching design system

✅ **What's Coming in Week 2:**
- Real-time email delivery status from Brevo
- Link open tracking
- Resend invitations to specific recipients
- Automated reminder emails
- CSV export of tracking data

## Issue 3: Wrong Redirect from Bids Screen

### Problem
Clicking "View Bids" on an RFQ in bidding status redirects to `/distribute` instead of `/tracking`.

### Root Cause
The `handleResumeRFQ` function in `/bids/page.js` was sending ALL non-draft RFQs to `/distribute`.

### Fix Applied

Updated the navigation logic in `/apps/platform/src/app/(dashboard)/bids/page.js`:

**Before:**
```javascript
} else {
  router.push(`/rfq/${rfq.id}/distribute`);
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
} else if (rfq.status === 'bidding' || rfq.status === 'published') {
  // For RFQs in bidding/published status, go to tracking page
  router.push(`/rfq/${rfq.id}/tracking`);
} else {
  // For completed/cancelled RFQs
  router.push(`/rfq/${rfq.id}/review`);
}
```

**Now the flow is:**
- **Draft RFQs** → `/upload` or `/create` (resume editing)
- **Bidding/Published RFQs** → `/tracking` (view invitation status)
- **Completed/Cancelled RFQs** → `/review` (view final results)

## Testing Checklist

### Email Delivery Test:

1. ✅ Set BREVO_API_KEY in `.env.local`
2. ✅ Verify sender email in Brevo dashboard
3. ✅ Restart dev server
4. ✅ Create/resume an RFQ
5. ✅ Go to distribute page
6. ✅ Add test email (use your own email)
7. ✅ Set deadline and click "Send Invitations"
8. ✅ Check server console logs
9. ✅ Check your email inbox
10. ✅ Check Brevo dashboard statistics

### Navigation Test:

1. ✅ Go to `/bids` page
2. ✅ Click on draft RFQ → Should go to `/upload` or `/create`
3. ✅ Click on bidding RFQ → Should go to `/tracking`
4. ✅ Verify tracking page shows invitation stats
5. ✅ Verify no 404 errors

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

✅ **Emails should be delivered** (if Brevo is configured correctly)
✅ **Tracking page loads** with invitation statistics
✅ **Bids screen navigates** to correct pages based on RFQ status
✅ **Server logs show** detailed email sending information

## Still Need Help?

If emails are still not sending after:
1. Setting BREVO_API_KEY
2. Verifying sender email
3. Restarting server

**Share these with me:**
- Server console logs (after sending invitation)
- Brevo dashboard screenshot (API key masked)
- Email logs from database query above

I'll help debug further!
