## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Document Format:** Currently only supports PDF. Excel/Word files not supported.
2. **Parsing Accuracy:** AI extraction confidence varies (60-95% depending on document quality)
3. **Timeout:** Llama Parse polling has 60-second max timeout
4. **File Size:** 16MB limit per file (UploadThing constraint)
5. **No Draft Saves:** Bidders must complete submission in one session

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue:** Upload fails
**Solution:** Check UPLOADTHING_TOKEN env variable, verify file size <16MB

**Issue:** Parsing takes too long
**Solution:** Check Llama Parse API key, increase polling timeout if needed

**Issue:** Extracted data incorrect
**Solution:** Users can manually edit all fields; AI extraction is assistive, not required

**Issue:** "Invalid token" error
**Solution:** Verify invitation exists, check expiry date, ensure token is 32 chars
