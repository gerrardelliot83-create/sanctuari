# Fixes Applied - October 3, 2025

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **RFQs Page - Bidding Tab Navigation** ✅

**Issue:** RFQs in "Bidding" status pointed to distribute page instead of tracking page.

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `/apps/platform/src/app/(dashboard)/rfqs/page.js`
- Line 306: Changed from `/rfq/${rfq.id}/distribute` to `/rfq/${rfq.id}/tracking`

**Result:** Clicking "View Bids" on bidding RFQs now correctly opens the tracking interface.

### 2. **Document Upload Interference** ✅

**Issue:** When uploading one document (quote or policy), the other uploaded document would sometimes disappear. This happened because:
- Handlers were using stale `quote` prop reference
- Multiple simultaneous updates were overwriting each other
- Spread operator `...quote` was capturing stale state

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (Problematic):
onUpdate({
  ...quote,  // ❌ This 'quote' reference could be stale!
  newField: value
});
```

When parsing was happening and a second upload occurred, the `quote` reference in the first handler didn't reflect the second upload's changes.

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Changed state update to functional pattern:**
   ```javascript
   // Line 166-170
   const updateQuote = (quoteId, updates) => {
     setQuotes(prevQuotes =>  // ✅ Use functional update
       prevQuotes.map(q => q.id === quoteId ? { ...q, ...updates } : q)
     );
   };
   ```

2. **Removed stale spread operators from handlers:**
   ```javascript
   // AFTER (Fixed):
   onUpdate({
     quoteDocumentUrl: fileUrl,  // ✅ Only update specific fields
     quoteDocumentFileName: fileName,
     // ... only the fields being updated
   });
   ```

   The parent `updateQuote` function now handles the merging with current state.

**Files Modified:**
- `/apps/platform/src/app/bid/[token]/page.js`
  - Line 166-170: Functional state update
  - Line 585-590: Quote upload handler (removed spread)
  - Line 610-621: Parsing update (removed stale spread)
  - Line 640-645: Policy upload handler (removed spread)

**Result:**
- Documents now persist correctly during simultaneous uploads
- No more data loss when parsing happens alongside uploads
- State updates are atomic and based on current state

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After deploying these fixes:

### Navigation Fix:
- [ ] Go to /rfqs page
- [ ] Click on "Bidding" tab
- [ ] Click "View Bids" on a bidding RFQ
- [ ] Should navigate to `/rfq/[id]/tracking` (not distribute)

### Document Upload Fix:
- [ ] Open bid submission portal
- [ ] Upload quote document → Should stay uploaded
- [ ] Upload policy document → Both should remain
- [ ] Upload policy first, then quote → Both should remain
- [ ] Try uploading while parsing is happening → No data loss
- [ ] Upload multiple times → Previous upload should not disappear

## 📊 Technical Details

### Why Functional Updates Matter

**Problem with Direct State:**
```javascript
const [quotes, setQuotes] = useState([]);

// Handler captures 'quotes' at render time
const updateQuote = (id, updates) => {
  setQuotes(quotes.map(q => ...));  // ❌ Uses stale 'quotes'
};
```

**Solution with Functional Update:**
```javascript
const updateQuote = (id, updates) => {
  setQuotes(prevQuotes =>           // ✅ Gets current state
    prevQuotes.map(q => ...)
  );
};
```

### Why We Removed `...quote` Spread

**The Issue:**
1. User uploads quote document → `handleQuoteUploadComplete` called
2. Upload handler has reference to `quote` prop from render
3. Parsing starts (async)
4. User uploads policy document → `handlePolicyUploadComplete` called
5. Parsing completes → calls `onUpdate` with `...quote`
6. But `quote` from step 2 doesn't have policy document!
7. Policy document gets overwritten with empty data

**The Fix:**
Only update the specific fields being changed. The parent component's `updateQuote` function merges with current state automatically via `{ ...q, ...updates }`.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. Deploy these fixes
2. Test document uploads thoroughly
3. Verify RFQs navigation works

### Upcoming:
1. **Create Bid Review Page** (`/rfq/[id]/review`)
   - View all submitted bids
   - Compare bids side-by-side
   - Download bid documents
   - See extracted data
   - Make decisions

2. **Enhance Tracking Page**
   - Show bid count
   - Link to review page when bids exist
   - Real-time updates when new bids arrive

## 🔍 Monitoring

Watch for these in logs after deployment:

**Good Signs:**
```
[Quote Upload] Complete: { fileUrl, fileName, fileSize }
[Policy Upload] Complete: { fileUrl, fileName, fileSize }
[Quote Parse] Success: { premium, coverage, ... }
```

**Bad Signs (should not see these anymore):**
```
❌ Document URL undefined after upload
❌ policyDocumentUrl reset to null
❌ quoteDocumentUrl missing after parsing
```
