if (rfq.status === 'draft') {
  // Check for responses
  const hasResponses = await checkResponses(rfq.id);
  navigate to: hasResponses ? '/create' : '/upload'
} else if (rfq.status === 'bidding') {
  navigate to: '/distribute'
} else {
  navigate to: '/review'
}
```

### CSS Architecture
- ‚úÖ BEM naming convention
- ‚úÖ CSS variables for all colors
- ‚úÖ Responsive breakpoints at 768px
- ‚úÖ Smooth transitions (0.2s ease)
- ‚úÖ Loading spinners with keyframe animations
