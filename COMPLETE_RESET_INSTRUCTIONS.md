## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Run Migration 012 in Supabase

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of:
   ```
   /packages/database/migrations/012_reset_products_and_questions.sql
   ```
3. Click **Run**
4. You should see notices like:
   ```
   Preserved X RFQ mappings for restoration
   Disabled foreign key constraint on rfqs.product_id
   Deleted all RFQ questions
   Deleted all insurance products

   ========================================
   Migration 012 Complete!
   ========================================

   NEXT STEP (REQUIRED):
   Run the reload script...
   ```

### Step 2: Run the Reload Script

Open terminal and run:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/DELL/Desktop/sanctuari
node scripts/reload-all-products.js --clean
```

The `--clean` flag will:
- Delete all existing test RFQs
- Delete all RFQ responses
- Start completely fresh

You should see output like:

```
=== Reloading All Products and Questions ===

Found 45 JSON files to process

Step 1: Checking for existing user RFQs...
  Found 10 existing RFQs

  üóëÔ∏è  --clean flag detected: Deleting all existing RFQs...
  ‚úì Deleted all 10 RFQs and their responses

Step 2: Loading products and questions from JSON files...

Processing: baggage_insurance_json.json
  ‚úì Created product: Baggage Insurance
    Product ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  ‚úì Inserted 18 questions

Processing: boiler_pressure_plant_json.json
  ‚úì Created product: Boiler and Pressure Plant Insurance
    Product ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  ‚úì Inserted 30 questions

...

‚úì Loaded 45 products with ~1,500 total questions

Step 3: No RFQs to update (clean start)

Step 4: Re-enabling foreign key constraint...
```

### Step 3: Re-enable Foreign Key Constraint

Copy and paste this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE rfqs
ADD CONSTRAINT rfqs_product_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (product_id)
REFERENCES insurance_products(id);
```

Click **Run**.

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works

Run the diagnostic script:

```bash
node scripts/diagnose-product-issues.js
```

Expected output:

```
üìä SUMMARY
================================================================================
Products with questions: 45
Products without questions: 0
Products with RFQs: 0
‚ùå PROBLEMATIC (RFQs but no questions): 0

‚úÖ PRODUCTS WITH QUESTIONS
================================================================================
[All 45 products listed with question counts]

‚úì Diagnosis complete!
```

### Step 5: Test RFQ Creation

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev` (if not already running)
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/rfq/create`
3. Select any product (e.g., "Contractors All Risk Insurance")
4. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Questions load correctly
   - ‚úÖ All sections appear
   - ‚úÖ Can navigate between sections
   - ‚úÖ No "No questions configured" error

---

## üîç Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

### Check all products have questions

```sql
SELECT
  p.name,
  p.category,
  COUNT(q.id) as question_count
FROM insurance_products p
LEFT JOIN rfq_questions q ON q.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, p.category
ORDER BY question_count ASC, p.name;
```

**Expected:** All products should have `question_count > 0`

### Count total products and questions

```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM insurance_products) as total_products,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rfq_questions) as total_questions,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rfqs) as total_rfqs;
```

**Expected:**
- `total_products`: 45
- `total_questions`: ~1,500
- `total_rfqs`: 0 (after clean start)

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Script fails with "Directory not found"

Make sure you're running from the project root:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/DELL/Desktop/sanctuari
pwd  # Should show: /mnt/c/Users/DELL/Desktop/sanctuari
```

### Script fails with "Error creating product: duplicate key"

This means products already exist. Either:
1. Migration 012 wasn't run correctly
2. Script was run twice

Solution: Re-run migration 012, then run the script again.

### Foreign key constraint error

If you see: `violates foreign key constraint "rfqs_product_id_fkey"`

This means the constraint wasn't dropped. Run in Supabase:
```sql
ALTER TABLE rfqs DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS rfqs_product_id_fkey;
```

Then re-run the script.

### Some products still missing questions

Check if JSON files are present:
```bash
ls -la /mnt/c/Users/DELL/Desktop/sanctuari/Resources/processed-rfq-questions/ | wc -l
```

Should show 46 lines (45 files + header).
